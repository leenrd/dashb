This is a Dashboard project bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Getting Started

First, create a repo from this template repo:

```
npm i
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
